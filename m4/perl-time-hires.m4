# ---------------------------------

# be a shell glob, which is expanded once for each path entry.
# That is, AClocal_PATH_PROG_GLOBS_FEATURE_CHECK([PERL], [perl-*]) will
# test each program named something like 'perl-*' found anywhere on the
# path.  Due to the syntax conflict with Autoconf string quoting,
# character sets (e.g. perl-[56]*) are not supported.

# AC_PATH_PERL_WITH_TIME_HIRES_STAT
# ---------------------------------
# Check for a version of perl that supports Time::HiRes::stat.
# This was added to perl core in 5.10 and it's convenient to
# have a consistent 'use 5.0xx' baseline for all the perl scripts,
# so that is the version we require, even though technically we
# could be getting away with 5.8 or even 5.6 in many of the scripts.
# (Note: Files shared with Automake do not necessarily use our baseline.)
